# Portfolio
Welcome! This repository is a living archive of my technical journey outside the classroom. It serves as a bridge between my academic studies and my goal of breaking into the Finance & Fintech industry.

The projects here are a mix of quantitative finance experiments and "just for fun" builds that keep my logic sharp.

Feel free to use the code uploaded, it is basic, but certainly helps understand the concepts they are about.
